# AATHIN-AAWYE
Open-source arcade/hacker space idea. "AATHIN AAWYE" = Doric for "Everything Everywhere".

## General Idea
Arcade based on purely open-source software. All games will be open source and so we encorage contributions/forks by patrons/members/anyone else.

By day the arcade would operate a bit like a casual coffee shop with people dropping in for to play games, chill out or grab a cheap coffee. 

By night it would be a pub alternative alcohol-free zone.

It would host regular coding events/ hackathons / challenges. These would improve the games at the arcade and the skills of our patrons.

The arcade hardware would be fairly simple (old computers/ raspberry pi's) housed in arcade style MDF boxes fitted with big buttons and joy sticks. The design of such hardware would (where possible) again be open source. Some games may also use VR/AR visuals or interactions. 

## Money
It seems a bit odd to pay for games that are made/maintained for free by our patrons. People are really paying for the space and the chance to show off their skills/learn new ones.

Initially three payment systems are proposed:
1. Pay-per-minute (~5p/min?) - where patrons pay a flat rate wether eating, drinking, playing or coding. 
2. Memberships - annual/season ticket. 
3. Sponsorship - with the aim that the sponsorship can be used to lower membership fees.

We could supplement this income by taking a few machines to higher foot-fall areas and charging per play. This would also be an opportunity for promotion.

As the hardware is cheap and the software is free we would mostly need funding for:
1. Rent
2. Staff salaries
